# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

For all repositories in the PHP-Parallel-Lint organisation, the latest patch version of the current major is supported for security updates.

Security patches will be backported to a previous major branch for up to a year after the last (non-security) release for that major.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All packages in the PHP-Parallel-Lint organisation are developer tools and should generally not be used in a production (web accessible) environment.

Having said that, responsible disclosure of security issues is highly appreciated.

**Please do not report or discuss security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Issues can be reported privately to the maintainers by opening a Security vulnerability report in the appropriate repository.

### Preferences

* Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined impact.
* Include the version number of the vulnerable package in your report.
* Fixes are most welcome.
    A private PR can be created from the security report to work on and discuss the patch.
